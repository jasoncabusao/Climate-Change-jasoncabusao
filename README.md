# Climate Change

Climate change is a pressing issue around the globe that has differential impacts on individuals based on where they live and their financial status. In this report, I built an interactive Shiny application exploring CO2 emissions data compiled by Our World In Data.

## Introduction

Discussions and conversations regarding climate change are increasing as temperatures across the globe experience polarizing highs and lows. People all over the globe are trying to limit their carbon footprint, however, the average individual can only do so much. Big companies and factories are the main drivers for CO2 emissions. On a larger scale, how are individual countries contributing to the emission of CO2? Countries with policies that surround attaining a cleaner carbon footprint tend to have lower CO2 emissions. Are lower income or higher income countries contributing the most to CO2 emissions. Which countries are contributing the most to CO2 emissions? The dataset, "CO2 and Greenhosue Gas Emissions," helps answer these questions. We will be exploring emissions from regular CO2, consumption CO2, gas CO2, land-use change CO2, and oil CO2. We will also explore the amounts that different countries emit of these CO2 types throughout different time ranges.

## Data

The dataset "CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions" is a collection of data about CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics. The data was collected, aggregated, and documented by Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser, Edouard Mathieu, Bobbie Macdonald, and Pablo Rosado. The dataset is maintained by Our World In Data whose mission is to create data and conduct research on the worldâ€™s largest problems while making them understandable and accessible. The data is collected and built upon a collection of other datasets. The purpose of this data is to examine which countries are emitting hazardous amounts of CO2 and which countries aren't. Additionally, this dataset was created to help make data surrounding important issues more understandable.

One possible limitation of this dataset is the use of multiple sources as the basis for their data. Since "CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions" is built upon other datasets, are all the datasets measuring CO2 the same way? If one dataset measures CO2 emissions in a different way than the others, it can misrepresent the actual amount of CO2. The authors would have to make sure and verify that all the datasets that they're using have the same measurement procedures.

## Summary Statistics

There are 4 socioeconomic classes that contributed to CO2 emisions in 2021. Lower income countries emitted 196.777 million tonnes of CO2. Lower middle-income countries emitted 5601.217 million tonnes of CO2. Upper middle-income countries emitted 17450.885 million tonnes of CO2. Higher income countries emitted 12659.199 million tonnes of CO2 in 2021. From these statistics, it's apparent that upper-middle income countries emit the most CO2.

1954 was the year with the largest number of CO2 emissions per capita with 1495.151 million tonnes per person. 1859 was the year with the largest number of land-use change CO2 emissions per capita with 1800.788 million tonnes per person.

The country that had the highest annual amount of CO2 emissions per capita is Sint Maarten (Dutch part) in 1954. Sint Maarten (Dutch part) emitted 771.886 million tonnes of CO2 per person. Seemingly, Sint Maarten (Dutch part) also had the highest annual amount of CO2 emissions from oil in 1954. In 1954, each person emitted in Sint Maarten (Dutch part) emitted 771.886 million tonnes of CO2. This is important to note since CO2 per capita and CO2 from oil per capita result in the same number. However, Cote d'Ivoire had the highest annual CO2 emissions from land-use changes, with each person emitting 228.145 million tonnes in 1859. Lastly, Qatar had the highest annual emissions of CO2 from consumption in 1997, with each person emitting 63.445 million tonnes of CO2.

## Visualization Conclusion

From the visualization, we are able to attain a better understanding of different countries CO2 emissions over time. We're able to see how different types of CO2 emissions (land-use, oil, consumption, etc.) vary over time, and how they vary with each country. We can identify years where certain CO2 emissions either drastically increased, or drastically decreased. With that, we can investigate what historical events happened that year and conclude that it contributed to a country's CO2 emissions.
