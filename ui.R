intro_p <- paste0("Discussions and conversations regarding climate change are increasing as temperatures across the globe experience polarizing highs and lows. People all over the globe are trying to limit their carbon footprint, however, the average individual can only do so much. Big companies and factories are the main drivers for CO2 emissions. On a larger scale, how are individual countries contributing to the emission of CO2? Countries with policies that surround attaining a cleaner carbon footprint tend to have lower CO2 emissions. Are lower income or higher income countries contributing the most to CO2 emissions. Which countries are contributing the most to CO2 emissions? The dataset, \"CO2 and Greenhosue Gas Emissions,\" helps answer these questions. We will be exploring emissions from regular CO2, consumption CO2, gas CO2, land-use change CO2, and oil CO2. We will also explore the amounts that different countries emit of these CO2 types throughout different time ranges.")

data_p <- paste0("The dataset \"CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\" is a collection of data about CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics. The data was collected, aggregated, and documented by Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser, Edouard Mathieu, Bobbie Macdonald, and Pablo Rosado. The dataset is maintained by Our World In Data whose mission is to create data and conduct research on the worldâ€™s largest problems while making them understandable and accessible. The data is collected and built upon a collection of other datasets. The purpose of this data is to examine which countries are emitting hazardous amounts of CO2 and which countries aren't. Additionally, this dataset was created to help make data surrounding important issues more understandable.")

data_p2 <- paste0("One possible limitation of this dataset is the use of multiple sources as the basis for their data. Since \"CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\" is built upon other datasets, are all the datasets measuring CO2 the same way? If one dataset measures CO2 emissions in a different way than the others, it can misrepresent the actual amount of CO2. The authors would have to make sure and verify that all the datasets that they're using have the same measurement procedures.")

With that, we can investigate what historical events happened that year and conclude that it contributed to a country's CO2 emissions.")

This chart also allows us to see certain patterns that arise.
